Certainly! Here's a fully-fledged guide on how to send data from a form
to a database using PHP and MySQL. The guide will include step-by-step
instructions and code examples. You can use the provided Markdown syntax
to publish it on your GitHub repository and make it visually appealing.

Sending Form Data to a Database with PHP and MySQL Prerequisites Basic
knowledge of HTML, PHP, and MySQL. A web server with PHP and MySQL
support set up. Step 1: Create the Database Table Start by creating a
new table in your MySQL database to store the form data. For example,
let's assume the table name is users, and it has the following columns:

id (INT, AUTO_INCREMENT, PRIMARY KEY) name (VARCHAR) email (VARCHAR)
message (TEXT) You can use the following SQL query to create the users
table:

sql Copy code CREATE TABLE users ( id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
name VARCHAR(255), email VARCHAR(255), message TEXT ); Step 2: Create
the HTML Form Create an HTML form where users can input their
information. Here's an example form with input fields for name, email,
and message: html Copy code
```{=html}
<form action="process_form.php" method="POST">
```
`<label for="name">`{=html}Name:`</label>`{=html}
`<input type="text" name="name" id="name" required>`{=html}

`<label for="email">`{=html}Email:`</label>`{=html}
`<input type="email" name="email" id="email" required>`{=html}

`<label for="message">`{=html}Message:`</label>`{=html}
```{=html}
<textarea name="message" id="message" required></textarea>
```
```{=html}
<button type="submit">
```
Submit
```{=html}
</button>
```
```{=html}
</form>
```
Step 3: Create the PHP Script to Process Form Data Create a new PHP
file, process_form.php, to handle the form submission and store the data
in the database.

In process_form.php, establish a database connection using the
appropriate credentials:

php Copy code `<?php
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "your_username";
$password = "your_password";
$dbname = "your_database";

$conn = new mysqli($servername, $username, $password, $dbname);

if ($conn->`{=html}connect_error) { die("Connection failed:" .
\$conn-\>connect_error); } ?\> Retrieve the form data using PHP's
\$\_POST superglobal:

php Copy code `<?php
// ...

$name = $_POST['name'];
$email = $_POST['email'];
$message = $_POST['message'];
?>`{=html} Prepare an SQL statement to insert the form data into the
users table:

php Copy code `<?php
// ...

$stmt = $conn->`{=html}prepare("INSERT INTO users (name, email, message)
VALUES (?, ?, ?)"); \$stmt-\>bind_param("sss", \$name, \$email,
\$message); \$stmt-\>execute();

if (\$stmt-\>affected_rows \> 0) { echo "Data inserted successfully!"; }
else { echo "Error:" . \$stmt-\>error; }

\$stmt-\>close(); ?\> Close the database connection:

php Copy code `<?php
// ...

$conn->`{=html}close(); ?\> Step 4: Test the Form Submission Start your
web server and open the form page in a web browser.

Fill out the form with some sample data and submit it.

If everything is set up correctly, you should see the success message,
indicating that the data has been inserted into the database.

Conclusion Congratulations! You have successfully implemented a PHP
script to send form data to a MySQL database. By following the steps
outlined in this guide, you can capture user input and store it securely
in your database for further processing.

Remember to secure your code by implementing proper input validation,
data sanitization, and database access control measures to protect
against security vulnerabilities.

Feel free to customize the code and expand upon it to meet your specific
requirements. Enjoy coding!

By following the above steps, you can send form data to a database using
PHP and MySQL. You can now publish this guide on your GitHub repository
using the provided Markdown syntax. If you have any further questions or
